# osTicket Help Desk Setup on Azure VM

## Project Summary
For this project, I deployed and configured **osTicket**, an open-source help desk system, on a **Windows 10 virtual machine** hosted in **Microsoft Azure**.  
The project demonstrates a practical implementation of a ticketing system, including server setup, PHP configuration, MySQL database creation, and accessing the web interface.

**Technologies and Tools Used:**
